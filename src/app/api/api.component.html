    Congratulations you've made it this far. Now we want this page to be an interface for a small api. This api will return a list of abandoned homes in baltimore. Follow instructions below
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make an API get request for all the data at <u>https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/qqcv-ihn5.json</u>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add an error handler.
        </li>
        <li>
            When request comes back display a <u>table</u> of all unique neighborhoods with the number of vacant buildings next to it. The table headers should be neighborhood and vacancies<br/>
            Ex: Sandtown | 56
        </li>
        <li>
            The table should display Total of vacancies in the bottom of the table
        </li>
        <li>
            Style the table so that the table header is bold<br/>
            the second colomn in the table is blue<br/> 
            and the table footer Total and Sum are bold and red.
        </li>
        <li>
            If data does not come back, add an error handler to display "Something went wrong" in the middle of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            After this is completed review and refactor you code. Extra points are for mobile responsive layouts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Push this code back up to your repo and email a link to us. 
        </li>
    </ol>
